ABOUT:
A dynamic webpage designed to allow users the opportunity to see giphs about their favorite singers/artists by entering their names.

BEHIND THE SCENES:
The user types in the name of their favorite singer/artists in the form field.... And then clicks the submits button.
The singer's name is then added to the array which forms a button, for the user to click.
When the new button is clicked, the javascript will GET 10 Giphs related to the singer from https://api.giphy.com and place them on the webpage.

When the user clicks one of the still gifs it will release the animated version, and if it is clicked again it will return to the still version. The rating [G, PG, PG-13 etc] will also be displayed under each gif
